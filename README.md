# Life of Introspection -- Personal NLP Research Project üìñ
## Maya Soleimani
### Summer I&II     -     University of Michigan - Dearborn

# 

### This project parses through 300 diary entries in a 10 year range, capable of different statistics of your choosing of emotional polarity vs. specified independent variables.
#
### Requirements:
#
#### + Written in *Python*
#### Libraries used: 
#### + import datetime
#### + from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
#### + from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
#### Files Needed:
#### + loi.py
#### + .txt file with your entries where each line follows this format: 
####    ‚Äú05/17/2014 1853 Today was such a bad day, and I‚Äôm just not feeling well overall. For some reason, it‚Äôs been so hard to wake up in the morning. 1906‚Äù
#### (date, start time, entry, end time)
#### + .txt with manually labeled polarity score with entry to test accuracy. Amount of lines should be a decent chunk of original entries, in this project I used approximately 1/10th of original data. The format of this file follows this format:
#### "negative Today was such a bad day, and I‚Äôm just not feeling well overall. For some reason, it‚Äôs been so hard to wake up in the morning."
